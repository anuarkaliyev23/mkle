# markdown-lua-extender

This is a pet-project for learning Rust.

## Goals

Provide markdown superset allowing extendable scripting be done. Superset is intended to be "source" code
for the compilation, producing plain markdown file for compatibility.

Extendable scripting is intended to be done via lua scripting language with custom functions addable without 
recompiling source code in Rust
